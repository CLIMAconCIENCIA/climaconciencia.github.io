Ocean circulation is an intricate balance between the diabatic processes that change water 
mass properties and the adiabatic processes that move water masses. In observations and 
models the more subtle diabatic processes like mixing and air–ice–sea interactions are 
often masked by adiabatic variability driven by wind and eddies. My overarching research 
vision is to understand how diabatic and adiabatic processes drive the ocean circulation. 

<h2>The Southern Ocean overturning circulation in thermohaline coordinates</h2>

Deep, cold and salty water is drawn to the surface ocean around Antarctica. 
This is controlled by the combined action of winds blowing over the sea surface 
and the stirring by large 100‐km eddies. Studying the ocean around Antarctica is 
notoriously challenging. We therefore have sparse ocean measurements in this region. 
This limits our understanding of some of the processes involved in the circulation of 
deep water, notably, a stage involving the warming and freshening of deep water to form 
intermediate water. Intermediate water plays a key role in drawing excess anthropogenic 
heat and carbon dioxide from the sea surface into the interior ocean. My recent work shows 
that the conversion of deep to intermediate water involves a two‐stage “cold transit” 
that takes place over the course of the austral season. First, during the winter, deep 
water sits below the very cold and fresh surface water. Ice formation around Antarctica 
makes this surface water slightly saltier, decreasing the density difference between the 
deep and surface water. This drives a mixing which cools and freshens the deep water 
while drawing it to the surface. Second, during summer surface warming and melting sea 
ice warm and freshen this deep/surface water mixture forming intermediate water.
